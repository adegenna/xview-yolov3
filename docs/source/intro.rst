Introduction
=====================

The following project is a Python implementation of the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm. This specific software began as a project intended for use with the Xview dataset specifically by Glenn Jocher at Ultralytics (https://github.com/ultralytics/xview-yolov3.git). It has since been modified extensively for the purposes of generality, maintainability, and usability by Anthony DeGennaro at Brookhaven National Laboratory (adegennaro@bnl.gov).
